## Business Problem 

Elimu Kwa Wote(EKW) is a non-profit educational institution whose goal is to educate all people about the word of God. As a start the founders have been spreading this life giving message through songs, community outreach and skits. Recently it was suggested in one of their board meetings that EKW should tap into the movie industry to spread the message of God's love through thrilling , entertaining and mind boggling movies. One of the core values of Elimu Kwa Wote is Lifelong Learning. So it was established that before embarking on the process of creating bible based educational movies, an analysis of the movie industry should be done to establish the main movie genres that most people are watching. With the analyis results,the Elimu Kwa Wote movie committee will be able to pick out themes and stories in the bible that speak of topics and issues that are present in the world today and turn them into soul captivating stories so as to spread the life giving message of God's love to the world enjoyably and memorably.
